    <h1>Code Club resources &amp; docs</h1>
    <p>
      NorwichTech code club resources and documentation - if you're interested in learning more about coding contact me via Twitter <a href='https://twitter.com/jamestinman'>@jamestinman</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>The point of it</h2>
    <p>The basics of coding have not changed for decades, even though technical advances have vastly increased what it is possible to achieve.</p>
    <p>Code Club requires no pre-requisites; it is specifically for people who are interested but don't know how to get into it. Each session builds up the knowledge in core programming concepts, but these are applicable to any programming language.</p>
    <p>Over the course of 8 weeks we build a functioning web application, with links to learn more about each area.</p>
