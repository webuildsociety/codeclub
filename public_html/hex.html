    <h2>What is HEX?</h2>
    <p>
      HEXADECIMAL (or HEX for short) is a way of representing a number from 0 to 15 using the letters A to F for the numbers 10 to 15.
    </p>
    <table>
      <tr><th>Normal Decimal:</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th><th>5</th><th>6</th><th>7</th><th>8</th><th>9</th><th>10</th><th>11</th><th>12</th><th>13</th><th>14</th><th>15</th></tr>
      <tr><td>HEX equivalent:</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Why is this useful?</h2>
    <p>It saves space. Computers love numbers that are multiples of "2" (because <a href='/binary.html'>binary</a>) and counting up to 10 takes up the same amount of space as counting up to 16 so you may as well.</p>
    <p>But when you display it on screen or print it out it takes less space to write "F" than it does "15" and "FF" than "255".


    <h2>Colours and stuff</h2>
    <p>This depends on how bloody marvellous your screen is, but MOST screens can cope with a mix of 256 shades of red, 256 green and 256 blue (which astonishingly is more than 16,000,000 colours)</p>
    <p>This is most easily represented as a HEX value with 2 characters for red, 2 for blue, 2 for green.</p>
    <p>Also note we put a hash in front of HEX values, e.g. #ff = 255</p>
